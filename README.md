# Underwater-image-generate

 In this experimence, We have used four type GAN：DCGAN，WGAN_GP，ACGAN，SGAN running this code, if you want to run this code, just choose the version of GAN, then change some code about the file path of train dataset. For example:

python dcgan.py

The underwater image data collection from web crawler collection, there are five type: Coral, Jellyfish, Parrotfish, SeaAnemone, Zebrafish. The original image and the GAN generated image are visualized as fol
